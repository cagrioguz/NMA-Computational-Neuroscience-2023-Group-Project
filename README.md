Investigating the Trial Novelty Effect on Modeling the Neural Activity in Face-Selective Areas
Contributors: Sara Azarnoush, Sungje Kim, Osman Cagri Oguz 
Previous literature suggests that contextual novelty may enhance and facilitate visual processing. In this exploratory project at the end of the 3-week Computational Neuroscience Course from Neuromatch Academy, we wanted to investigate the effects of a novel or repeated stimuli category of the faces-houses ECoG dataset from Miller et al. (2015) concerning the previous trial. To do this, we applied different models and compared their fitting performances. These include Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, and Polynomial Regression.
